🔌 IoT-Based Smart Energy Meter with SMS Alert (ESP32 + PZEM-004T)

An IoT-based real-time energy monitoring system using ESP32, PZEM-004T energy meter, MQTT dashboard, LCD display, and SMS alerts via Circuit Digest Cloud API.
This project enables remote monitoring of electrical parameters and instant fault notifications with low latency and minimal hardware complexity.



📌 Features
📊 Real-time monitoring of:

•	Voltage

•	Current

•	Power

•	Energy consumption

•	Frequency

•	Power Factor

📱 Live MQTT dashboard

📟 16×2 LCD local display (I2C)

🚨 SMS alert for abnormal conditions






🧠 Why PZEM-004T?

The PZEM-004T (V4.0) is a reliable AC energy measurement module that eliminates complex calibration required by sensors like ACS712 or ZMPT101B.

Measured Parameters
Parameter	Range
Voltage	80 – 260V
Current	0 – 100A
Active Power	0 – 23kW
Power Factor	0.00 – 1.00
Frequency	45 – 65Hz
Energy	0 – 250000 kWh





⚙️ How It Works

PZEM-004T measures AC electrical parameters using:
Direct voltage input
External CT (Current Transformer) on live wire
ESP32 reads data via UART (Modbus)
Data is:
•	Displayed on LCD
•	Published to MQTT dashboard
•	If abnormal conditions are detected:
SMS alert is sent using Circuit Digest Cloud API

🔌 Circuit Overview

ESP32 UART:
TX → GPIO 17
RX → GPIO 16
LCD connected via I2C (Address: 0x27)
CT clamped only on the live wire
PZEM handles high-voltage isolation internally
⚠️ Do NOT connect neutral and live both through CT
